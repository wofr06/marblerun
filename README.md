# Perl package Game-MarbleRun (repository marblerun)

The aim of Game-MarbleRun is to register marble run tracks built with
GraviTraxÂ® from Ravensburger and to be able to rebuild and visualize them.
Marble run tracks can be imported from a file into a database and exported
for the exchange with others. The Power elements are not supported.

Depending on the language environment and available localizations the output
of the program is in english or according to the current locale.
Only german is fully supported right now. A french localization file `fr.po`
contains most element and set names only. Further language files can be
generated using the script `make_gravi_po_file`

## CONTACT

### AUTHOR
If you found bugs or have marble runs you like to share then you can contact
me. If you have ideas for improvements, can provide translations or like to
contribute code or patches then I would like to hear from you as well.
If you built a marble track with the official Gravitrax App and have
difficulties to translate it in the notation used here, I can try to help.
In this case please do mail me your (buggy) file containing the attempt to
note down the track and if possible an Gravitrax identifier where I can
see the track you built. The identifier and the code will not be distributed
further in any form and all info on my side gets deleted as soon as the issue
is fixed.
