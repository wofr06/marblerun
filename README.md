# Perl package Game-MarbleRun (repository marblerun)

The aim of Game-MarbleRun is to register marble run tracks built with
GraviTraxÂ® from Ravensburger and to be able to rebuild and visualize them.
Marble run tracks can be imported from a file into a database and exported
for the exchange with others.

Depending on the language environment and available localizations the output
of the program is in english or according to the current locale.
Only german is fully supported right now. A french localization file `fr.po`
contains most element and set names only. Further language files can be
generated using the script `make_gravi_po_file`
